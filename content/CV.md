#### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE	
<br>

**Postdoctoral researcher**, *current position*\
California State Polytechnic University Humboldt, Arcata CA (Jan. 2024)\
Developing culturally-relevant environmental data science curriculum with multi-institutional network. Funded by Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. 

<br> 

**Ph.D. Dissertation**\
*Urban tree drought resilience and outdoor water conservation in a Mediterranean climate: insights from an ecohydrologic model*\
Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, UCSB, Santa Barbara CA (2017 - 2023)

  - developed novel method of vegetation parameterization in ecohydrologic model (RHESSys) using high resolution vegetation indices and lidar-derived LAI data 
  - developed module within surface routing code for sub-grid water sharing 
  - ran model simulations of variation in outdoor water use during drought, findings show that conserving water by 25% would have minimal effects on tree carbon cycling and ecosystem services
