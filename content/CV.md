#### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE	
<br>

**Ph.D. Dissertation**\
*Urban tree drought resilience and outdoor water conservation in a Mediterranean climate: insights from an ecohydrologic model*\
Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, UCSB, Santa Barbara CA (2017 - 2023)

  - developed novel method of vegetation parameterization in ecohydrologic model (RHESSys) using high resolution vegetation indices and lidar-derived LAI data 
  - developed module within surface routing code for sub-grid water sharing 
  - ran model simulations of variation in outdoor water use during drought, findings show that conserving water by 25% would have minimal effects on tree carbon cycling and ecosystem services

  - Jackson Forest thinning project, simulating carbon fluxes from redwood forest with climate change effects
  - Urban stream nitrate project, summarizing green infrastructure and ecohydrologic modeling literature, simulating urban nitrogen cycling
